,,GC 274,2 - My Name Is...,"Words have power, and names more so. Personally, growing up as an Asian American without an ""Americanized"" name, I was subject to jokes about my name. These jokes were not necessarily cruel in nature, but for a good amount of time, I think I resented my own name, although eventually, I grew to appreciate and love my name. Through this workshop, I wish to open a discussion of the power of names; what our (as in the APIA community) names mean to us, especially for those of us with non-Americanized first names; and to explore the themes of identity and names through the experiences we, as Asian Americans have, as many of us live with 'Asian' names, whether it is our given name, a middle name, or our last name.",Eurie Kim,kim.eurie9696@gmail.com,,Molly,,
,,GC 269,"3 - Discovering Our Voices: Storytelling, Literature, and Writing ","Often times, it is difficult to tiptoe the line between exploring our cultural roots and finding our own individuality as Asian Americans through writing. We exist in an in-between of stereotypes and expectations -- an amalgamation of cultural influences from our heritage and upbringing. Mainstream Asian American literature (such as The Joy Luck Club and The Woman Warrior) is often criticized for their authenticity or lack thereof -- does this affect our own writing and how so? This workshop will explore the process of finding our unique selves through writing while still recalling and drawing upon our cultural roots. ",Ed Lin,ed@edlinforpresident.com,,Sandra,,

,,GC 265,4 - Curatorial Research and Process,"A case-study examining the exhibition FOLD: Golden Venture Paper Sculptures organized by the Museum of Chinese in America. The popular perception is that history museums are only concerned with the past, but how can a history museum make historical materials relevant today, and what are the limits of interpreting artwork when used to discuss present day societal issues? Andrew Rebatta, Assistant Curator, will present on curatorial dilemmas and strategies employed during the exhibition development process behind FOLD, which featured artwork created by asylum-seekers from China while they were unjustly detained in York County Prison during the mid-1990s.

,,GC 261,5 - Critical Nostalgia: Negotiating Heritage for Asian artists in the North American Diaspora,"Often caught between the white gaze of the art world and our own self-romanticizing pitfalls, visual artists have used critical histories to help dismantle stereotypes of exoticism and Orientalism. At the same time, there are aspects of our identity that could become complicit to settler-colonialism and other forms of oppression if left unspoken. This workshop explores the nuances of dis/empowerment when it comes to denying or including visual elements of our heritage in artwork. It shows the ways in which Asian artists from the diaspora have navigated their identity and its presentation through a critical nostalgia.",Florence Yee,florence.cg.yee@gmail.com,,Emily,,

,,,7 - We Are the Ones We've Been Looking For,"Asian Americans have always been involved in movements for justice.  In this period of escalated attacks on communities of color, poor communities, LGBTQ people, women's bodies, the environment, etc., it is important for us to build common language and across identities.  Facilitators will work with participants to understand the current moment, and share the work of organizations in NYC and CA that are working to fight systemic racism and articulating a vision for a world we build together.",Israt Audry,israt@seeding-change.org,,,,

,,GC 274,"2 - Appropriators or Originators? Asian-Americans, Hip-Hop, and Authenticity","Where do we draw the line between appropriation and appreciation? How can Asian creates make work that contributes to Hip-Hop culture without decentralizing Black and Brown voices and narratives? And, most importantly - did Bruce Lee and 2Pac die for this? Chinese-American rapper jason chu discusses the complicated relationship between Asian-Americans and Hip-Hop culture, including issues of authenticity, media representation, and showing up for the Black and Brown community.",Jason Chu,jasonchumusic@gmail.com,,Burhan,,
,,GC 269,3 - Take the Mic: Sharing Our Voices Through Interactive Narratives,"The Girl Who Sees is a role-playing fantasy video game that engages players with Filipino culture through interactive storytelling. Created by a team of Filipino-Americans and Filipinos (and a couple of allies), the game is meant to elevate and showcase Filipino-American narratives not only to a primarily Western audience, but also to empower and encourage other members of the Filipino diaspora to speak up and speak proud. Cultural, institutional, and systematic racism has historically downplayed the the importance of AAPI representation. The lack of Asian and Asian-American visibility is the consequence of these biases. This workshop will explore portrayals of Filipinos and Filipino-Americans in the arts and media. Members of the TGWS team will share their personal experiences of expressing Filipino culture through gaming, dance, writing, and other forms of media. We will help participants brainstorm ideas on how they can voice their own cultural narratives with basic online and creative tools.  Our goal is to encourage this workshop's participants to find their own ways of expressing their Asian heritage and unique experiences through the arts. By sharing our experiences and creating an open brainstorming session, we hope to give the participants the tools necessary for them to walk away feeling empowered to make change. Let's take the mic, turn up the volume, and tell our stories!",Patti Umali,interintellectus@gmail.com,,Janette,,
,,GC 265,4 - Public / Private Space: A Critical Mapping of Washington Square Park,"Psychogeography is the study of how our environment affects our emotions and behavior, while emotional cartography is a method of capturing our relationship with a place through memory, sensory perception, and local history. As amateur mapmakers and lifelong walkers, we are committed to the idea that everyone should know where they are, in every sense of the terms place and community. Participants will be given an introduction to psychogeography and a brief rundown of Washington Square Park's history. Then together we will wander through Washington Square Park with the intent of re exploring the space we know well, while considering the park's history, what the area means to us, and using our senses. Post-walk we will have a discussion about our experiences.",Alina Shen,alinayshen@gmail.com,,Jessica,,

,,GC 261,5 - Navigating Mixed Race Identities,"Mixed race discourse tends to treat the whole population as a monolith, often focusing on a struggle between two cultures without delving into the realities of mixed race individuals. This workshop strives to dig deeper into the experiences of mixed race communities. What does it mean to be mixed race? How can we move beyond the rhetoric of hybridity? We hope to highlight the diverse realities of mixed race Asian Americans, from organizing against imperialism to building a united movement for liberation.

,,GC 288,6 - LGBTQ South Asian Artists,"The South Asian diaspora is filled with folks from incredibly diverse backgrounds and identities.

,,SC 95? ,"7 - People First By Design, An Intro to (equity-centered) design-thinking","The journey of self discovery and, ultimately, liberation includes understanding the historical context of a given situation and its influences on a society and individual. But, how might we imagine a future that puts people first -- their whole, unique, beautiful selves? In this light, what does it mean to understand the constructs that are at play and to work collaboratively to envision a future of liberation for all? This is where design-thinking within an equity-centered framework can shed light on pathways that can lead us to a radical future and the possible steps that may take us there. This interactive and introductory workshop will expose participants to the fundamentals of the design-thinking process and how it can be a powerful tool in the difficult, crucial work of making a radical future real.",Esther Kang,eyk@estherykang.com,,Richard,,
3,4 - 5:20,GC 275 ,1 - Thinking about Asias: A live playing of the game All Our Asias,"Sean Han Tani will lead a discussion during a live playthrough of his game All Our Asias. The main character, Yuito, a Japanese-American, enters a world constructed from his estranged father's memory. Along the way, Yuito learns of his father's activism history. He also begins to complicate his understanding of what it means to be Asian, as he moves beyond the notion that ""Asia"" is a single concept or uniform place of ancestral descent.

,,GC 274,2 - Asian American Feminism: On Navigating Fetishization and Sexualization,"""You're so exotic!"" ""I love Asian women!"" Where did the fetishization and objectification of Asian women come from? How did Asian women get the hypersexualized stereotypes of being docile and submissive or dangerous and seductive? The fetishization of Asian women is rooted in legacies of white sexual imperialism, U.S. militarism, and exclusionary immigration policies. Using a framework of Asian American feminism, this interactive workshop draws on storytelling exercises, media analysis, and historical contexts to examine how sexual stereotypes born from violence and war get reimagined by media and entertainment and reproduced and normalized in everyday contexts, and also concludes with practices for resistance.",Julie Ae Kim,julieaekim@gmail.com,,Whitney,Y,"Markers, Big sticky pads "

,,GC 269,3 - Interconnected Global Struggles: Socialism in Vietnam post-Revolution,"U.S. women organizers and activists participated in a women's delegation to Vietnam hosted by the Vietnam Women's Union. Our delegates shared our women's movements in the U.S. while the delegation took this time as an opportunity to learn about the successes of VWU's organizing, where they have 16 million members and are organized at the national, provincial, and communal levels. This workshop will cover the work of VWU including domestic violence, microcredit loans, supporting the political leadership of women, and also lessons learned on Vietnam's recovery post-war and building towards socialism. Hear about the reflections from U.S. women's movement and Vietnam's women's movement.",Cathy Dang,cdang@caaav.org,,Lillian,Yes,
,,GC 265,"4 - Resilience Through Art: How SEAs Have Mobilized, Healed, and Resisted Through Creative Modes of Self-Expression","Art is storytelling. Art is healing. Art is resilience. Art is preserving. Join Dianne L̻ to learn about the potential for art to be a powerful tool for social change.

Learn how to bridge communicative, generational, and cultural gaps within Southeast Asian communities to cultivate new means of healing, resistance, and advocacy.",Dianne Le,dianne.le@rutgers.edu,,Xuan,,
,,GC 261,"5 - Rise, Resist, Revolt: Home in Revolution","""Rise, Resist, Revolt: Home in Revolution"" examines how the Filipino nation and identity, as shared by other Asian identities, were born out of revolutionary struggle. From Spanish colonization to the Marcos dictatorship to the present-day US-Duterte regime, Filipino activists have shaped their own history, culture, and identity. As Filipino youth scattered throughout the diaspora, time and distance disconnect us from our homeland, forcing us in the limbo of hyphenated identities. However, through this workshop, we will discuss, act out, and find creative ways in which we answer the call to serve the ongoing revolution back home, powerfully relearning and reaffirming the Filipino in ""Filipino-American.""",ANAKBAYAN,kasamanda.kj@gmail.com,,Sabrina,,
